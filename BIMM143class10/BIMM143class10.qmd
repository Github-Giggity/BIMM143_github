# The PDB Database

First let's see what is in the PDB database-
the main repository of protein structures

Downloaded composition stats from: 

https://tinyurl.com/statspdb


```{r}
##remmeber you gotta put the downloaded file 
##in the same location as the R
stats<-read.csv("PDBStats.csv", row.names=1)
stats

##There is a problem here due to the commas n #
##This causes R to treat them as characters

x<-stats$X.ray
##gsub to replace
##first is the comma then none to replace 
##and of course x
gsub(",", "", x)
##as.numeric to change to numeric #
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
```
```{r}
rm.comma<-function(x){
  as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
}

rm.comma(stats$EM)

##I can use 'apply()' to fix the whole table
##2 for apply to column, second
##rm.comma for function as argument third
##stats for the x or array matrix first
pdbstats<-apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
rownames(pdbstats)<-rownames(stats)
head(pdbstats)
##now we want to find the total
## so we do sum
totals<-apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)
##since totals alone just give you numbers
##you need to make it into percentage
##use round to do so
##totals/totals alone would be wrong
##totals/totals["Total] shows
##you are interacting with the total number
##of occurance so they give you the right
##% value. 2 is the decimal place
round(totals/totals["Total"]*100, 2)
```
>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are 
solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. 

84.83 and 8.33 respectively

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein? 

```{r}
round(pdbstats[,"Total"]/sum(pdbstats[,"Total"])*100,2)

##Q.3 skipped
```
```{r}
library(readr)
read_csv("PDBstats.csv")
```

```{r}
##Fraction of Uniprot

##Protein structures in PDB as a fraction of 
##Uniprot sequences

round((pdbstats[1,"Total"]/251600768)*100,2)


```

Here is a lovely figure of HIP-Pr with 
the catalytic ASP residues, the MK1 compounds 
and the all important water 308. QUestion 6

Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. 
Why do we see just one atom per water molecule 
in this structure?

Too small resolution of 2 armstrong is 
bigger than the hydrogen of water. 
You need 1 armstrom or better to see such small atoms. 

Q5 There is a critical “conserved” water molecule 
in the binding site. 
Can you identify this water molecule? 
What residue number does this water molecule have?

Water HOH 308

##The bio3d package for structural bioinformatics

```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb<-read.pdb("1HSG")
attributes(pdb)

head(pdb$atom)
pdb

```
##Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Let's finish today with a bioinformatics calculation to predict the functional motion of a PDB structure. 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")

adk
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")

```
